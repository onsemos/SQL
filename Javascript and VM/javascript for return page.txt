    if only going back and nothing being saved i see no harm in using validSubmit('return');
    but if data can be saved then the first option should be used to go back without saving


    there are some additional properties that do the same but with additional functionality
    .href requires complete url
    .pathname requires url after domain/
    .reload bypasses cache but our meta tags should account for that
    .replace(url)  i believe is same as .href
